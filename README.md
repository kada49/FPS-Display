# FPS-Display
The FPS Display Mod is made to be used with the Minecraft Forge Loader for the Minecraft version 1.8.9. At the moment not all planned features are implemented.

## Features
The mod can display an FPS Counter on one of the four corners. When you open the chat and have the Counter on one of the bottom corners it dissapears to see chat better. Until now (version 1.3.1) you can personalize the color of the text, toggle a shadow, a background, enable or disable the suffix/prefix and change the scale.

You can check if a new version is available by typing `/fps update`. This is also done automatically the first time joining a world/server after a you launched Minecraft.

## Configuration
In the configuration (accessed with `/fps`) you can personalise the Overlay how much you want.

There are also links to the Github repository and my Discord name for support.

## Incompatibilities
* [FPSSpoofer](https://www.9minecraft.net/fps-spoofer-mod/): Since the FPSSpoofer changes the FPS value displayed any other readout gets a value of 0.
